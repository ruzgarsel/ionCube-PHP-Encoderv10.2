7th Mar 2018 - Encoder 10.2.0 released 
Encoder 10.2.0 released. This is a free update for 10.0 Encoder users.
Includes a new Encoder for PHP 7.2.
New bundled encoding options allow encodings from different encoders to be included in the same encoded file.
Fix for a crash that could occur when the Encoder was attempting to acquire a license for itself and
permissions on the licensing directory meant that files could not be created.
Fix for an issue in the 7.1 Encoder whereby private methods were not called if there was an 
overriding method in a sub-class. Specifically, there was a call to the private method from a parent method 
and that parent method had itself been called from the child class.
Fix for incorrect yield from parsing corresponding to PHP bug 74302 (https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=74302).
